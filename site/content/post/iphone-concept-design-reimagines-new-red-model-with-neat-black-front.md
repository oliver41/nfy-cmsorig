Apple might have only dropped its [special (RED) edition](https://thenextweb.com/apple/2017/03/21/apple-red-iphone-ipad/) of the [iPhone](https://thenextweb.com/topic/iphone/ "Read more about iPhone.") 7 less than 24 hours ago, but one resourceful designer has already imagined a whole new appearance for the handset – and it looks absolutely stunning.

Render artist [Benjamin Geskin](https://twitter.com/VenyaGeskin1/status/844201479774855168) took to Twitter to share an intriguing concept design that reimagines the (RED) iPhone with a black front. While the overall changes essentially boil down to replacing the white front with a black one, the outcome is quite appealing – especially to [connoisseurs](https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/844277751108517889) of black and red.
